## teams-downloader

A script that downloads the latest meetings in Microsoft teams for my specified classes

## What works:

 - Downloading from a particular team (currently just one for testing)
 - Notification with PyAutoGUI when download takes place
 ## Things to try adding:
 - Checking if the file already exists
 - Proper error handling
 - Folder organization (placing all the downloads from each team in their own folders)
 - Renaming the downloaded files to reflect the date and subject
 - Batch download
